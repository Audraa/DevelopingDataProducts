# Developing Data Products  Project


This directory contains the Ui.R and Server.R, developed as part of the coursera course project. 

This is a simple application and it uses the Mtcars dataset that ships with R.

There are three variables used in this project. 

Cyl - cylinder
dip - displacement
mpg - Miles per galon

The user can select the number of cylinder they wish to see when plotting the mpg vs dip,

There are four cholces

 4, 6,8 and All. 
 
 The "All" option selects all the cylinders.
 
 When the option is selected this is passed back to server and the plot is then drown
 
 Notice the title of the chart also lets you know what cylinder you are looking at.
